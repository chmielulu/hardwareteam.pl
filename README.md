# Hardware Team

Storefront for an online store, which I had the pleasure to work on. Unfortunately, but the project bombed and I wasn't able to finish it. You can view a preview using this [link](https://trusting-bassi-7f34f4.netlify.app/).

## How to run this site?

Just fetch all dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn`, and then `npm run start` or `yarn start`.

## What does this project include?

The site includes:

- Homepage
- Login & Register
- List of products, categories
- Articles
- Product Page
- Dark mode using [Dark Reader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/darkreader)
- Hot shot
- User Panel
- Basket
- Discount codes
- and others...

## Technology

I used the following technologies to build this site:

- React.js
- React Router
- React Redux
- Styled Components
- Iconify
- Storybook
- And others less important...

For structure managing I used [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/). Full list of dependencies you can see in package.json.

## Important informations

I realize that many things could be improved here. For example catalog `_components` is unnecessary and complicates the structure in a meaningless way. Later, I realized about this.

Next is storybook, components I created later on don't have this. Components that I created earlier and that have a preview in the storybook, I modified later during the writing of the project and I no longer checked if something in the storybook stopped working.

Another issue is testing, it's just missing here

The structure of the files, especially `assets` is very messed up.

Image loading and page rendering times could be optimized

A few more things can be listed here, but under time pressure I left out some things. I had a lot of things to do and very little time, and on top of that I was doing it all by myself.

## Design

I also created the design myself by taking inspiration from several major online retailers. **The graphic design currently belongs to someone else, so it is forbidden to use it.**
